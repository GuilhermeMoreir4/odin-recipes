# odin-recipes

I already know a little bit about HTML and CSS, so I tried to do something at my level.

I learned how to put images in the title tag.

Also, I learned how to use the text justification effect — like in a word processor — which gives a cool style to the recipes.

A really cool project. I loved doing it!
